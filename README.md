# Gauss Seidel Method 

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative numerical technique used for solving systems of linear equations.It is an improvement over the Jacobi method, where each equation in the system is solved sequentially, and the most recent values are used to update the variables. 

## Key Features:

- **Diagonally Dominant Check:** The code checks if the provided system of equations is diagonally dominant

- **Rearrangement:** If the equations are not diagonally dominant, the code rearranges them to achieve diagonal dominance

- **Solution:** Once diagonal dominance is confirmed or achieved, the code solves the system of equations using the Gauss-Seidel method.
